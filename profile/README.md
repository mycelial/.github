# Hello ðŸ‘‹
We are [Mycelial Inc.](https://mycelial.com), and we offer modern data
infrastructure for AI at the Edge.

> What does this mean?

Out of necessity, Edge AI moves computing away from the data
center to the edges of the network where the data is generated. This means your
resource-intensive AI applications, must be local applications, to function
properly.

This raises an important question, which is:

> "How do you access the important information on your edge devices?"

You could spend engineering time trying to synchronize the data on your edge
devices with your data center, but this is a hard problem to solve, and you can
save yourself a lot of time and effort by using Mycelial to move your data where
it needs to go.

Mycelial offers you an easy solution to your data movement needs.
